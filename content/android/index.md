# Prerequisites
## System Requirements
+ Quad-core 2300 MHz processor
+ 2 GB RAM
+ OpenGL ES 3.0
+ EGLImage extension
+ Android 4.4.4, Android 5.0 or higher

# Integration
Vidhance SDK is based on a versatile C library with the possibility of integration at many different levels.
## Wrap Driver
We provide solutions to wrap the camera driver on your device and implement Vidhance as a modular middle layer between the operating system and the camera driver. This is a smooth solution when you do not want to modify the actual camera driver but want Vidhance integrated on a system level. [Click here for instructions](gettingstarted)
## Into Driver
If you are interested in using Vidhance at a driver level we provide support for integration in conjunction with low level optimizations.
## Into App
We offer the possibility to enhance your application with Vidhance technology by using the Android Native Development Kit to gain the performance of a low level API at application level.
